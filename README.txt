Note: I had to really rush through the video so I might have missed some functionalities, I hope if I do happen to miss something or didn't get to thoroughly showcase something 
like what was intended, I could perhaps showcase it privately in a demonstration. I worked hard on this project, especially as this is my first big project in a foreign coding language.
Thank you.

I have also attached the sample files for testing load/save, and left the debug button in there just incase.
